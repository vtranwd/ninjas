**In order of importance:**

1. Minimum Viable Product:
    - The parts of the game completed so far are the following according to the User Stories:
        - Users will see a 200px x 500px rectangle on the screen in which they can move their avatars.
        - Up and Down keys are assigned correctly for each player.
        - The "shoot" keys launch "darts" corresponding to the color of the player at the time of keypress.
        - The color  change key changes the player's and player's bullets' colors in full correspondence.
        - The players cannot move past the top and bottom borders of the stage.
        - As a user, "bullets" that match the same color as the player they hit do no damage, but those of the opposing color do 1 hit point of damage each.
        - A life bar representing the number of hit points is displayed above the player avatars and below the game's title, appended to the top of the stage.
    - Ongoing MVP:
        - A window should pop up when any player's health bar reaches "0".
        - The end game window should remove all functionality from the players.
    - Icebox:
        - If everything worked perfectly, I would have a button that would start the game in a "showdown mode", which puts the players on a stage that is 25% shorter in height than the normal game mode.
        - Additional things include sound effects, gif explosions, and image sprites taking the place of the rectangular avatars.

README:
1. NINJA DUEL
    A game where the player is a ninja, cloaked in black or white, and launches darts that match your color at the opposing side. The background for the white ninja is white, and the background of the white ninja is black. This makes it hard to see the darts until they have crossed the halfway point across the screen, so players must act quickly to dodge! First person to take their opponent's hit points to 0 WINS!
2. Javascript, HTML, CSS, JQuery
3. The game follows a standard arena "shoot em up (shmup)" style. There is a small boxed area where both players navigate up, down, and shoot.
