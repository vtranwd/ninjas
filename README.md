**In order of importance:**

1. Minimum Viable Product:
    - User Story
        - Users will see a 200px x 500px rectangle on the screen in which they can move their avatars.
        - The rectangle is divided by color where the left half is black and right half is white. This is the play area.
        - A blue life bar is displayed below the game's title, in the left and right upper corners of the play area.
        - Up and Down keys are assigned correctly for each player.
        - The players cannot move past the top and bottom borders of the play area.
        - The "shoot" keys launch "darts" corresponding to the color of each respective player.

    - Ongoing MVP:
        - A window should pop up when any player's health bar reaches "0".
        - The end game window should remove all functionality from the players.

    - Icebox:
        - If everything worked perfectly, I would have a button that would start the game in a "showdown mode", which puts the players on a stage that is 50% shorter in height than the normal game mode.
        - Additional things include sound effects, gif explosions, and image sprites taking the place of the rectangular avatars.

README:
1. NINJA DUEL
    A game where the player is a ninja, cloaked in black or white, and launches darts that match your color at the opposing side. The background for the white ninja is white, and the background of the white ninja is black. This makes it hard to see the darts until they have crossed the halfway point across the screen, so players must act quickly to dodge! First person to take their opponent's hit points to 0 WINS!
2. Javascript, HTML, CSS, JQuery
3. The game follows a standard arena "shoot em up (shmup)" style. There is a small boxed area where both players navigate up, down, and shoot.
